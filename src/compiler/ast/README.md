# The Kataw AST specification

Kataw's own AST represents the structure of an ECMAScript program as a tree and conforms both to the ECMAScriptÂ® 2021 specs and TypeScript **latest**.

The AST have been designed for performance, and it nearly eliminates the chance of accidentally creating an AST that does not represent an ECMAScript program while also
supporting a *hybrid* definition of *concrete syntax*.

## Node

```js
interface Node {
    kind: NodeKind;
    multiline?: boolean;
    parent: Node | null;
    flags: NodeFlags;
    transformFlags: TransformFlags;
    emitNode: EmitNode | null;
    start: number;
    end: number;
}
```

The `Node` contains all AST nodes represented as `Node` object, which may have any
prototype inheritance.

The `kind` field is a string representing the AST variant type, and contrains a serie of
bitwise masks - allows you to group AST nodes very easily. For example
`kind & NodeKind.IsIdentfier` or `kind & NodeKind.ContainsList`.

The `start` and `end` are default properties representing the start and end values of each `AST node`.

## RootNode

`RootNode` represent both `Module` and `Script`.

The `module` property should be set to `true` if parsing in [`module mode`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-modules) or `false` if parsing in
[`script mode`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-scripts).

The current `flags` property keeps track of which context you are currently parsing in, and it's property contains a serie of
bitwise masks that can be parsed by reference. This information isn't known from outside, or exposed through any API.

```js
interface RootNode <: Node {
    kind: NodeKind;
    source: string;
    filename: string;
    statements: [ Statements ];
    jsx: boolean;
    module: boolean;
    diagnostics: [ Diagnostics ];
    parent: Node;
    emitNode: Node;
    detached: boolean;
    incremental: boolean;
    flags: NodeFlags;
    transformFlags: TransformFlags;
}
```
