# kataw

**WIP**

Kataw is a Javascript toolchain with insane performance that can

- parse Javascript, Typescript and JSX

- transform current ECMA code to older ECMA versions (*like Babel*)

- global API to perform AST manipulation and tree walkers

- Pretty printing (*like Prettier*)

- Linting (*like ESLint*)

- Minify (*Like Terser*)


## Current state

Only the Kataw parser, transformers, walkers, AST manipulation through global API is available as of now.

Soon as this code is in a "stable state" I will add the rest of the tools
