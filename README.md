This repo exist only to show off an alternative and improved AST than what can be seen in the EScaya repo.

It's conforms to latest ECMA specs, and the AST is designed to fullfill this goals with high performance:

* Error handling / recovery
* Incremental parsing
* Transformation
* Linter
* Minification
* JSX
* Typescript
* Pretty printing

**Note** None of these files are not completely up to date with my private code and will not be improved further.

I use this AST in my private project that includes all the bullet point above.

## Contribution

If you have ideas on how to improve this AST further - contribution is welcome.
