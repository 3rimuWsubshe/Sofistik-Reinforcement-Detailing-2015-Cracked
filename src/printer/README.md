  ## Printer

This files and folders contains an opinionated code formatter that can print Javascript source code with or without Kataw types.
It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping
code when necessary.

The pretty printer tries to be smart enough to be able to understand what you want. As a result the formatter will change based on your code style.
